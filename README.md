## Project Challenge
Lanakila Meals On Wheels is currently lacking a mass communication tool to send out notifications to senior citizens; a better communication tool is needed to relay messages quicker regarding natural disaster warnings, schedule changes, recalls, etc. with user confirmation that the notification was received. 

## Project Proposal
Our application will allow administrators to sends out mass messages via text message to alert customers and volunteers regarding natural disaster warnings, schedule changes, recalls, last minute changes etc. Administrators have the ability to create a voice message to be sent to participants of the Meals on Wheels program; this message is then converted from voice to text using natural language processing later sent to all users through text messaging applications. The application will also feature a web page that displays a record of sent messages; this enables the general public to stay notified on recent updates.

### Tech Stack:
1) Natural Language Processing
2) Amazon Web Services
3) Third party mass messenger application
4) Voice Recognition & Speech Synthesis
5) SQL Databases
6) HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Scope (MVP):
1) Webpage for admins to access (login and password) and create messages to send out
2) Integration of Natural Language Processing with text messaging (voice to text)
3) Mass communication tool
4) Different user access rights
5) Visual asthetics
6) Public webpage displaying previously sent messages

### Stretch Goals:
- User confirmation that notification/message was received 
- Schedule volunteers and manage shifts (Daizzy)
- Convert text to voice (sent as an automated call/voicemail)
- Different user mediums (phone calls, voicemail)
